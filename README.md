# Predictive Analytics - End to End ML Project
Welcome to my end-to-end machine learning project! I’ve built a robust solution to predict math scores of kids, leveraging data-driven insights to empower educational outcomes. This project showcases my expertise in statistical analysis, experimentation with multiple ML models, UI development, and deployment—delivering a complete, real-world ML pipeline.

# Project Goals
**Predict Math Scores**: Accurately forecast students’ math performance using historical data.<br>
**Model Exploration**: Test and compare various ML algorithms to find the best performer.<br>
**Statistical Insights**: Uncover key patterns and relationships through rigorous analysis.<br>
**User-Friendly Interface**: Provide a simple UI for easy interaction with predictions.<br>
**Deployment**: Make the solution accessible via a scalable, live application.

# Features
**Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed raw data for optimal model performance.<br>
**Statistical Analysis**: Conducted EDA and hypothesis testing to identify significant predictors (e.g., study time, prior grades).<br>
**Multiple ML Models**: Experimented with models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost, with hyperparameter tuning for top accuracy.<br>
**Simple UI**: Developed an intuitive interface for users to input data and view predictions.<br>
**Deployment**: Hosted the app on a cloud platform (e.g. AWS) for real-time use.

# Tech Stack
**Languages**: Python<br>
**ML Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost<br>
**Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels<br>
**Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn<br>
**Version Control**: Git & GitHub
