# Predictive Analytics - End to End ML Project
Welcome to my end-to-end machine learning project! I’ve built a robust solution to predict math scores of kids, leveraging data-driven insights to empower educational outcomes. This project showcases my expertise in statistical analysis, experimentation with multiple ML models, UI development, and deployment—delivering a complete, real-world ML pipeline.

# Project Goals
Predict Math Scores: Accurately forecast students’ math performance using historical data.
Model Exploration: Test and compare various ML algorithms to find the best performer.
Statistical Insights: Uncover key patterns and relationships through rigorous analysis.
User-Friendly Interface: Provide a simple UI for easy interaction with predictions.
Deployment: Make the solution accessible via a scalable, live application.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed raw data for optimal model performance.
Statistical Analysis: Conducted EDA and hypothesis testing to identify significant predictors (e.g., study time, prior grades).
Multiple ML Models: Experimented with models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, with hyperparameter tuning for top accuracy.
Simple UI: Developed an intuitive interface for users to input data and view predictions.
Deployment: Hosted the app on a cloud platform (e.g. AWS) for real-time use.
